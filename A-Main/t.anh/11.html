        <h2>Unit 1: A day in the life of Mark Zuckerberg</h2>
        <div class="passage">
            Mark Zuckerberg is a busy guy. He runs Facebook, the social media giant, so it isn‚Äôt surprising that the technology wonder kid has quite a lot to do throughout the day. Despite being responsible for a company that makes over $400 billion every year, amazingly Zuckerberg still makes the time to exercise regularly, travel often, and spend time with his young family. How does he do it? Zuckerberg tries to keep his choices in life simple. Most people spend a lot of time thinking about what to wear or what to cook, where to go and what to do, but Zuckerberg never thinks about these things. He wakes up at the same time every day, checks Facebook and WhatsApp on his phone, then he usually works out in his personal gym at home. Zuckerberg typically exercises about three times a week, and sometimes he goes jogging with his pet dog. There‚Äôs nothing unusual about Zuckerberg‚Äôs diet. After exercising, he eats what he feels like for breakfast, then he‚Äôs ready for the day. Zuckerberg doesn‚Äôt like to waste time on small decisions. That‚Äôs also why he wears the same thing almost every day: jeans, trainers and a grey t-shirt. It‚Äôs not because he‚Äôs lazy or hates fashion, but because he doesn‚Äôt want to think about clothes. He wants to think about important things. Zuckerberg works 50 to 60 hours a week for his company, Facebook, but he thinks about the social media platform constantly. ‚ÄòI spend most of my time thinking about how to connect the world and serve our community better, but a lot of that time isn‚Äôt in our office or meeting with people,‚Äô he says. Most of his work is away from the office ‚Äì when he‚Äôs thinking of new ideas. When he‚Äôs not working, Zuckerberg spends some of his time learning new things. Currently, he‚Äôs studying Mandarin Chinese. He also tries to read as many books as he can ‚Äî in 2015, he read a new book every two weeks. He believes in having personal goals in life ‚Äì he thinks that we feel better when we learn or do new things. Travelling or working, Zuckerberg also spends a lot of time with his wife, Dr Priscilla Chan, and his two children. Like all parents, he thinks it‚Äôs important to have time with his family when they are young and growing up.

        <h2>Unit 2: Wimbledon</h2>
        <div class="passage">
             Wimbledon is the oldest tennis tournament in the world, and all the top tennis players want to win it. It‚Äôs very different from most of the other international tournaments, not only because it‚Äôs important and it‚Äôs on grass, but because players have to follow some very old-fashioned rules. Firstly, for example, they have to wear white ‚Äì white sports shoes and socks as well as white tops and white shorts or skirts. Nowadays, they can wear some colour on their clothes, but only if the colour is one centimetre wide or less. The rule is unpopular with some players because they think it is old-fashioned, and it makes people think that tennis is not a modern sport. They also want to wear what they feel like wearing, and some would like to wear advertising on their clothes, but they can‚Äôt. Other players like the rule ‚Äì it makes Wimbledon feel special and different. Women are allowed to wear shorts at Wimbledon, but most players prefer to wear sports dresses or skirts. Roger Federer, one of the most successful men‚Äôs players, sometimes wears a smart, white evening jacket when he walks on to the court at Wimbledon! He takes it off when he starts the match! Another tradition is also unusual in tennis. At Wimbledon, female players are called Miss or Mrs. So, the umpire will say, for example, ‚ÄòGame, Set and Match to Miss Williams‚Äô at the end of the match. Again, some people like the tradition, but other players think it‚Äôs too old-fashioned. Why can‚Äôt they use their whole name or just their surname like they do with the men? In other ways, Wimbledon is a very modern tournament. The Centre Court at Wimbledon is a fantastic place to play and watch tennis. It has an expensive and brilliantly-designed roof, so players don‚Äôt have to stop playing when it rains ‚Äì something that is not uncommon in London, even in July, when the tournament takes place. Winners get over ¬£2 million in prize money, and losing finalists get half that amount. The tournament makes a lot of money, not just from ticket sales, but also from television money, and from sales of food and souvenirs. Wimbledon is famous for selling strawberries and cream, and visitors eat an amazing 140,000 servings of strawberries every year. That‚Äôs a lot of strawberries ‚Äì and a great tradition!

        <h2>Unit 3: Taking the ferry</h2>
        <div class="passage">
            <p><strong>A</strong><br>Nowadays, bridges and tunnels mean that it‚Äôs easier and quicker, and often cheaper, to drive to places, or to take the train, than it is to cross rivers or seas on a ferry. The eight-kilometre-long Oresund Bridge links Sweden to Denmark, changing what was a long trip into what is now an easy commute. The Channel Tunnel between England and France means that you can leave one country and arrive in the other before you finish drinking your cappuccino. The problem is that cars and underground trains are not as romantic as ferries. It may be faster to use modern transport options but many people still prefer to take the ferry.</p>
            <p><strong>B</strong><br>Having time to look at the scenery, to relax and breathe, and to feel you are moving along slowly and naturally are just some of the reasons why travellers and commuters often prefer ferries. Urban ferry rides, which are short and cheap, are a daily ritual for many people. In Hong Kong, for example, many commuters choose the slow ferry over the fast underground when crossing Victoria Harbour. Enjoying the sea breeze at sunset makes many feel much better than being in a crowded train. From the ferry, you can see Hong Kong‚Äôs office towers in multi-coloured lights, attractive mountain tops, and the occasional historic ship sailing by. It‚Äôs better to get home late, feeling relaxed, than to get home early, feeling stressed.</p>
            <p><strong>C</strong><br>In New York City, more than 100,000 people ride ferries daily, and, every day, 80,000 people use ferries to get about Kerala in India. From the deck of the Staten Island ferry, which takes twenty-five minutes to go from New York to Staten Island, you can see amazing skyscrapers and monuments like the Statue of Liberty. From a ferry in Kerala, you can see kids riding bicycles and workers picking bananas and coconuts or laying laundry out to dry.</p>
            <p><strong>D</strong><br>Taking a ferry is a great way to get a feel for the rhythms of a place and even to meet some fellow passengers. In south-eastern Alaska, for example, the ferry system is the water highway for Alaskans. Being on the ferry is the best way to meet the locals. People tell stories and make friends on the ferries, and look at the scenery, thinking about why they love living in Alaska. As a visitor, it is a way to fall in love with the place.</p>

        <h2>Unit 4: Two adventurers of the year</h2>
        <div class="passage">
            <p><strong>Krzysztof Starnawski</strong><br>When Polish explorer Krzysztof Starnawski was eighteen years old, he went on a diving course and tried to dive, but couldn‚Äôt because he had problems with pressure in his ears. A few years later, he decided to take up a new challenge: caving. From the start, he loved his new sport. In Poland, there are a number of deep caves and Krzysztof began to explore them. Every time he reached the end of a new cave, he came across deep, dark water, but he knew that he couldn‚Äôt go into the water because of his ears. Then, during a cycling trip, he met a diving instructor who taught him how to deal with the problems with his ears. As a result, he completed a diving course. He was interested in an underwater cave in the Czech Republic called Hranicka Propast. The cave was deeper than any he knew. He wondered how deep it really was and spent many hours diving into the cave to explore it. Eventually, he decided that it wasn‚Äôt safe to dive any deeper so he started using an ROV, a type of robot explorer, to go down into the cave. In November 2016, the ROV hit the bottom, 404 metres below the surface. It was the deepest underwater cave in the world.</p>
            <p><strong>Ashima Shiraishi</strong><br>A New Yorker, Ashima Shiraishi discovered rock climbing when she was six years old. She was playing with friends after school in Central Park and saw some men on a climbing wall known as Rat Rock. She decided that she wanted to have a try. She started climbing in trainers and kept falling, but she loved it. She was having so much fun that she didn‚Äôt mind that the men were laughing at her because she was hopeless at climbing. Eventually she got to the top. From that moment she was determined to be a champion climber. Ashima‚Äôs climbing is a family effort. Her father travels round the world with her, and her mother helps make the clothes she wears. Although only fifteen, she is a champion American rock climber, and well known in her own country. Many people believe that she could be the best climber in the world one day. Ashima‚Äôs ambition is to win an Olympic medal at the next Olympic Games. Her talent and her dreams are big.</p>

        <h2>Unit 5: Fresno ‚Äì the recycling city</h2>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>Fresno in California is a small community 200 miles north of Los Angeles, mostly known for its agriculture. (0) __ B __ While many cities recycle 30 to 50 per cent of their waste, Fresno recycles as much as 73 per cent of its rubbish.</p>
            <p>(1) <select data-correct="D" class="gap-fill"><option value="">--</option><option value="A">A</option><option value="B">B</option><option value="C">C</option><option value="D">D</option><option value="E">E</option><option value="F">F</option><option value="G">G</option></select> Fresno is proud of being a city that is great at recycling.</p>
            <p>Patrick Wiemiller, Fresno‚Äôs public utilities director, showed me how the city does it. ‚ÄòWe provide a lot of education,‚Äô Wiemiller told me as we drove across town. ‚ÄòTo really get people to recycle, you have to change a family‚Äôs behaviour. We find the best way of doing this is through children in the schools.‚Äô (2) <select data-correct="G" class="gap-fill"><option value="">--</option><option value="A">A</option><option value="B">B</option><option value="C">C</option><option value="D">D</option><option value="E">E</option><option value="F">F</option><option value="G">G</option></select> Mums and dads are more likely to listen to messages from family members than to messages from public officials.</p>
            <p>As a result, the public utilities department is now confident that recycling 90 per cent of all waste is a possible goal. (3) <select data-correct="F" class="gap-fill"><option value="">--</option><option value="A">A</option><option value="B">B</option><option value="C">C</option><option value="D">D</option><option value="E">E</option><option value="F">F</option><option value="G">G</option></select> That may sound impossible, but it is a great aim to have.</p>
            <p>With so much waste to recycle, there are big challenges for private companies that have to recycle all the waste. (4) <select data-correct="A" class="gap-fill"><option value="">--</option><option value="A">A</option><option value="B">B</option><option value="C">C</option><option value="D">D</option><option value="E">E</option><option value="F">F</option><option value="G">G</option></select> ‚ÄòWhen we started, it was just paper, aluminium, tin, and glass,‚Äô Mohoff said. ‚ÄòNow we can do all kinds of plastics. And film too.‚Äô In total, that is nearly 7,000 tons of things that Fresnans throw out each month that end up being reused.</p>
            <p>Why does a community like Fresno care so deeply about recycling? One Fresnan farmer explained that aside from feeling they should look after the planet, it‚Äôs all about agriculture. (5) <select data-correct="E" class="gap-fill"><option value="">--</option><option value="A">A</option><option value="B">B</option><option value="C">C</option><option value="D">D</option><option value="E">E</option><option value="F">F</option><option value="G">G</option></select> But putting nutritious material back into soils improves crops and livestock ‚Äì and ultimately, the strawberries, pistachios, or garlic that the rest of the country gets from this region.</p>
